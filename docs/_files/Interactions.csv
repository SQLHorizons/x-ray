1,Aviva Internal Admin,k9s client,Terminal UI to interact with Kubernetes clusters and application control plane. Browser UI via Artifactory console.,N/A,,N/A
A,Artifactory Web UI,Artifactory Application,"Application UI, for detail of this component, review the Artifactory Design Document v4",Software/Tooling App Team,,Consumption handled via Kubernetes
B,x-ray Application,Kubernetes pod,2 * K8S Pods hosting x-ray docker container.  x-ray is a service plugin for Artifactory and included within the annual licence fee.  X-ray application is of type Replica-Set. This configuration will maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time across the k8s cluster that spans all three availability zones.  Thus although this is depieced across two AZs this solution spans all 3 due to the k8s cluster solution. ,Software/Tooling App Team,,Consumption handled via Kubernetes
